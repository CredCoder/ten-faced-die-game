## Rules:
1. There are two players. One is a called ROLLER and the other is a called SHOOTER. The default is to give ROLLER first shot. You can alternate who goes first or simply shoot for it with one roll each. In case of a tie, repeat.
2. Each player can shoot as many times as he likes until he rolls a blank face, wins, the sum of his total score so far and score for the round exceed 100, or he hits "SAVE". If the player's total score exceeds 100 then the last roll is subtracted and the roll button toggles to the other player. The first player whose total score equals 100 wins. Each player can only roll if the ROLL button allows them too; ROLL for ROLLER and SHOOT for SHOOTER.
