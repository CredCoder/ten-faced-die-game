## TEN-FACED-DIE-GAME

![Figure 1-1](https://raw.github.com/credcoder/ten-faced-die-game/master/images/figure1-1.jpeg "Figure 1-1")

## Rules
1. There are two players. One is a called ROLLER and the other is a called SHOOTER. The default is to give ROLLER first shot. You can alternate who goes first or simply shoot for it with one roll each. In case of a tie, repeat.
2. Each player can shoot as many times as he likes until he rolls a blank face, wins, the sum of his total score so far and score for the round exceed 100, or he hits "SAVE". If the player's total score exceeds 100 then the last roll is subtracted and the roll button toggles to the other player. The first player whose total score equals 100 wins. Each player can only roll if the ROLL button allows them too; ROLL for ROLLER and SHOOT for SHOOTER.
3. If SHOOTER shoots a blank,  his "CURRENT" score box is cleared and the SHOOT button toggles from SHOOT to ROLL.
4. Clicking too quickly can cause you to miss the toggle and shoot out of turn. If this happens you lose a turn and your opponent gets to toggle back to himself on his next blank roll.

## Background
I used this game as an opportunity to test my JavaScript coding skills. I am learning to code on my own with the purchase of a book called:

    JavaScript The Definitive Guide by David Flanagan
and a $10 online course from Udemy called:

    The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele
I want to focus on JavaScript so when I finished Colt's course I wanted to see what I actually learned. So I have been making projects on my own, for the most part, particularly with respect to the JavaScript coding. Some are variations on exercises from Colt's course like the Color Game and Todo List. This one, I used another $10 JavaScript course on Udemy called:

    The Complete JavaScript Course: Build a Real-World Project by Jonas Schmedtmann

This is a course that I was quickly going through to reinforce my JavaScript skills. I was given some starter CSS and HTML and I coded the JavaScript on my own as a coding challenge. I also changed the HTML and CSS to make the game look a little different leaving the structure and setup alone. This game is the result the original game is called the PIG GAME.
